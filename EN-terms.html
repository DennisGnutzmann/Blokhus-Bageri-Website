                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    We are only using cookies, that are absolutely necessary to make the website work.
                    Only information that our users directly input to our site will be saved. This includes
                    all products that are added to the shopping-cart, aswell as personal data that is submitted
                    in the order form. By using these functions, you automatically agree, that this information is saved as

                </p>

                <h3>Orders</h3>
                <p>
                    All orders handled by this website follow the Click&Collect scheme. You order with us and have to pick up
                    the ordered products directly in our shop (Aalborgvej 2, 9492 Blokhus). We do NOT deliver directly to your residence.
                    Payment can be handled directly and with cash or card when picking up your order. We also offer payments in advance
                    through the MobilePay app.
                    The way orders work with us is as follows:<br>
                    1. Add the products to the cart on this website<br>
                    2. Fill in the order form (Name, Date and time of pickup, prefered payment method)<br>
                    3. Send the order<br>
                    4. We receive the order and pack it to the desired point of time<br>
                    5. You pick up the order personally and pay directly in the shop (if not paid in advance)<br>
                </p>

                <h3>Handling of personal data</h3>
                <p>
                    The following information is saved as cookies and is transmitted to us when ordering:<br>
                    1. The given name<br>
                    2. The given date and time<br>
                    3. The prefered payment method<br>
                    4. The content of the shopping-cart<br>
                    By confirming the order, you agree that this information is transmitted to us in the following ways:<br>
                    The information is sent to us via email. We save these emails to manually handle the processing of the order,
                    meaning packing of the ordered products to the desired date and time. We will also use these emails as basis,
                    if anything ever goes wrong with the ordering process.<br>
                    These emails will not be forwarded by us and there will be no further processing of the information on our side.<br>
                    In addition to email, this information will also be sent directly to our label-printer in the shop. We use the 
                    SendFileToPrinter API provided by Zebra and this data transfer is secured via SSL/TLS. This is done to print the labels
                    we use to mark the packed order.
                </p>

                <h3>Right of objection, deleting of data and right of information</h3>
                <p>
                    You are legally allowed to revoke your agreement to us handling your data at any time. Please use our <a href="EN-contacts.html">contacts</a>.
