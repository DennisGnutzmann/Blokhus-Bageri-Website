                    <p>Todays Blokhus Bageri is looking back on a long history of bakers in Blokhus. Even back in the day when Blokhus was just a small and not well-known fishing village it already had its own bakery. Owner Anna ”Noo” Kristensen took the bakery over in (19??) and it has been run by her and her family since. Over the years a lot has changed both for us and Blokhus, in whose heart the bakery lies.</p>

                    <p>Nowadays Blokhus is a famous and very popular holiday destination, both for Danes and tourists from all over Europe. We have over the years adapted our products to the change of times while still staying true to the well-established danish baking traditions. As such we are proud to offer many of the ”old-school” danish-pastry and bread and cake and staying true to the traditional craft. However we have also adapted to newer trends and offer a balanced blend of tradition and innovation. Our bakery team, headed by baker-master Mads Warny Kristensen, dedicates themselves to upholding only the highest of quality.</p>

                    <p>A relatively ”new” addition is also ”Café Noo”, which has been added to the bakery in (????). There you can sit, relax and enjoy both our breakfast menu as well as cake and hot drinks in the afternoon.</p>
